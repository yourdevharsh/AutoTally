# AutoTally üìä

AutoTally is an intelligent web application that automates the tedious task of data entry from receipts. Simply define the data you need, upload your receipt images, and get a structured Excel file in seconds. This project leverages the power of Google's Gemini AI to understand and extract information from images.

## üöÄ Features

* **Dynamic Field Extraction:** Specify any fields you want to extract from your receipts (e.g., "Total Amount", "Date", "Store Name", "Tax").
* **Batch Processing:** Upload multiple receipt images at once and process them in a single batch.
* **AI-Powered:** Uses the Google Gemini model for accurate and reliable data extraction from images.
* **Instant Excel Export:** Automatically generates and downloads a `.xlsx` file containing the extracted data, ready for analysis.
* **Modern UI:** A clean and responsive user interface built with React and Tailwind CSS.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application follows a simple client-server architecture:

1.  **Frontend (React):** A single-page application built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS. It provides the user interface for selecting fields and uploading image files.
2.  **Backend (Node.js/Express):** A Node.js server using the Express framework to handle API requests.
    * It uses **Multer** to manage multipart/form-data, handling the image uploads.
    * It communicates with the **Google Gemini API** to process each image and extract the requested data based on a dynamic prompt.
    * It uses the **`xlsx`** library to compile the extracted JSON data into an Excel spreadsheet.
    * Finally, it sends the generated Excel file back to the client for download.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18 or later)
* npm or yarn
* A Google Gemini API Key

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/autotally.git](https://github.com/your-username/autotally.git)
    cd autotally
    ```

2.  **Install server dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    *(Note: If you have a separate `client` folder, you will need to `cd client` and run `npm install` there as well.)*

3.  **Create a `.env` file** in the root of the project and add your Google Gemini API key:
    ```env
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```

4.  **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    npm start 
    ```
    *This will typically run a command like `node server.js`.*

5.  **Open the application:**
    The server will start (usually on `http://localhost:3001` or a similar port). Open your browser and navigate to the address logged in the console.
